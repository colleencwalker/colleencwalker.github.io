I like to read about a variety of topics, and I am also a big fan of two NPR podcasts - The TED Radio Hour and Hidden Brain.  I plan on doing future blogs on several topics.  So, stay tuned for more!

# BOOKS

## FICTION
Teen Fiction
------------
I have a middle schooler that likes to read, but only if it is a good book.  The Maze Runner was his favorite so far.  As there isn't a great way that I know of to find out if a book will appeal to my son, I read a lot of books to see if he would like them.  He likes adventure stories, without too much complicated sci-fi or new-world stuff, with a boy lead.  

I also listen to books in the car, and I tend to like teen fiction for this.  Teen fiction has a simplier text structure and concepts, so it is easier to pay attention, when my full attention is supposed to be on the road.

## NONFICTION
Professional and Career Development
-----------------------------------
Yes, I love reading books on how to be a better leader, manager, doer of tasks, coach and mentor at work.  I find that many of these books take many pages to deliver a few key points.  Now I have a place to summarize these for myself, and anyone else that cares to read.

# PODCASTS
What I Learned from TED
-----------------------
Don't have time to listen to the hundreds of TED talks out there?  Not even enough time to listen to NPR's TED Radio Hour podcast?  No worries!  I will listen for you.  TED talks are awesome, and you can learn a lot of cool science trivia, but also some great facts to use in everyday life - from dealing with your kids to your boss.  I will be posting some of the key takaaways from upcoming podcasts.  Apologies in advance - just because I am interested in it, you may note be!

Unhiding the Brain
------------------
Another great podcast I love is Hidden Brain.  This is only abuot 25 minutes, and has some great insights on human behavior.  I find many useful tips for dealing with work.
