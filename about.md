I was born and raised in New Jersey.  Exit 7 (really).  I have a B.Che - a bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Delaware.  Yes, Blue Hens.  I have a Master's and Doctorate degree in pulp and paper from IPC/IPST, now known as RBI at Georgia Tech.

I am Technical Director at TAPPI, the technical association for the pulp and paper industry.  Before TAPPI, I worked at Georgia Tech, and several pulp and paper companies and suppliers.  You check out my LinkedIn profile if you'd like to know more about my professional background.

I have two super-awesome kids that I am very proud of.

I am learning French and German on Duolingo - a great free App.  Duolingo makes learning a language fun.  However, if you are the analytical type that likes to know the reasoning behind things, you will need to search that out.
