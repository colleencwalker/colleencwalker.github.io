I have never before visited Berlin, and I am really looking forward to seeing this great city later this year.  My interests lean towards learning about how people lived day-to-day during the difficult times leading up to and during World War II. 

Keep in mind, I am not presenting a history or complete record.  There are many, many books written about Berlin and the war.  I have read a very small faction of thees, just so that I can learn.

"The Jewish Problem" in Berlin
------------------------------

Displaced Compassion
--------------------
In Erik Larson's book about Ambassador William E. Dodd, the US's first ambassador to Hitler's Germany, brings his family to Berlin.  Dodd was unique as he was not part of the wealthy "Good Boys Club" that typically held diplomatic posts.  He balked at the expenses other diplomats incurred on parties and lifestyles.  The US government did not fund all of the excess Dodd saw, but did not stop it either.

Larson cites Dodd's observations that dogs and horses were never mistreated.  Dogs were not afraid of men since they weren't mistreated.  Dodd notes a "horse happiness" that abounds.  Horses were clean, fat and happy.  "German law forbade cruelty to animals and punished violators with prison".  Larson quotes Dodd directly:
> "At a time when hundreds of men have been put to death without a trial or any sort of evidence of guilt, and when the population literally trembles with fear, animals have rights guaranteed them which men and women cannot think of expecting."

Bombarded Berlin
----------------
I can't imagine what it is to live through a war and see my town destroyed.  Judt cites some terrible statistics about the effects of the war in his *Postwar*.  75% of Berlin's buildings were unihabitable after the final bombings in May 1945.  We have seen the pictures, but it is altogether something horrible to live through it.  

Joseph Kanon's *Leaving Berlin* is a great story of spying and double crossing in East Berlin right after the war.  As the characters move about the city, they comment on the rubble, the ruins, and the people trying to survive.  The main character visits the home of a family he was very close to, and little remains but the doorway.  Empty lots with piles of rubble fill familiar spots.

Judt cites that it is estimated that about 36.5 million Europeans died between 1939 and 1945.  This is equivalent to the total poluion of France in 1939.  Can you imagine that?  More than **half** of the dead were civilians.  

Schandung

Over 100,000 women were raped after Berlin was conquered by the Russians.  *A Woman in Berlin* is a riveting account of a woman's day-to-day life iN Berlin from April 20, 1945 to June 22, 1945.  She tells of the bombings and how she and her neighbors hide in their basements, the Russians that break through doors to get to the alcohol and the women, and living in the city as the Russians take over.  This anonymous writer was herself rapeed several times, and had to resort to a lifestyle she was not proud of but helped her survive.  

She also questions the rationale of the German leaders that advised that when the Germans retreated, they were to "leave the alcohol stores" when clearing out a city prior to invasion by the enemy.  The German leaders said that drunk soldiers couldn't fight well.  The anonymous writer says that if they had just thought about this command for a minute, they would have understood that alochol brings on sexual desires.  This would lead to more rape.  The writer's experience with Russians showed her that Russian needed alcohol to loosen up.  She wonders if there wouldn't have been half as many rapes if the alcohol had not been left behind.  

In our shock and horror of the atrocities of World War II, it is easy to forget about those the remained in the cities.  We think that all those left in Germany supported Hitler, and many of them did.  In *A Woman in Berlin* the author talks about how the people would say "It is all thanks to the Fuhrer" when things were going well, and used the same phrase when things turned terrible.  I wonder how disheartened they felt to at one time have so much faith in someone then to find out that he was mad and did terrible things.  

In our land of plenty, I can't image what it would have been like to live in Berlin after the end of the war.  There was no running water, no electricity, and no food.  Many people committed suicide as they were afraid of being raped or killed.  People were forced to work it Russia's looting of the industrial goodies of Berlin.  The diarist tells of endless hours gathering all types of metals - screws, ingots and the like - and packing rail cars until they were almost too full to move down the tracks.  During all of this advrsity, women had to continually put off and evade men.  Many young girls were hidden away in windowless rooms for months.
