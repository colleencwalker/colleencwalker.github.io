I had no idea that Budapest once rivaled Vienna for glamorous lifestyles, rich culture, and "the" place to be in Europe.  Two great wars changed all that.

I am not a history expert, journalist or travel writer.  I just like to learn a little about a place before I go.  
  
Isolation
---------
If you have ever traveled to a country to where you don't speak the language, you can understand how isolating it feels.  As a native English speaker, I can get by in many countries as so many people speak English.  It often makes it hard to learn a language when abroad as more people are interested in improving their English than helping you learn their language.  

I knew that Hungarians spoke their own language, but I did not realize that it was so unique or rare.  Hungarian is one of the three most popular languages in the Uralic Language group, so-called as these languages spread to both sides of the Ural mountains.  Finnish and Estonian are the other two most popular languages in this group.

While the Hungarian language belongs in this group, the language itself shares essentially nothing with the other languages in the Uralic Language group.  Only Hungarians speak Hungarian, which is notoriously difficult to learn.  

Trivia
------
Hungary has the largest Chinese population in Europe due to an agreement with China in that no visas are required

Cafe Culture
------------
As an American, European cafe culture is something alien to me and many Americans.  I learned quite a bit about this in my readings.  Cafes are not places just to eat meals and drink coffee, but gathering places to discuss politics, science and the arts.  We have no equivalent in the US – unless you consider happy hour at a bar.  But this is not the same.  Where do our intellectuals and artists meet to discuss their new ideas?  Most likely, among themselves within their own institutions.  I am sure at some universities there are noted hangouts where people gather and talk, but this is not part of the American way.  Why did our European immigrant ancestors leave this behind?

In Kati Marton's book The Great Escape, she eloquently describes how the nine scientists and artists she follows greatly miss the cafe culture.  There are no places where the intellectuals and artists gather to share and debate ideas new and old.  I keenly felt the loss of this environment by the men she follows.  

Cafe Europa is a splendid tale where most of the action occurs inside this cafe.  They drink cup after cup of coffee with whipped cream on top.  Hungarians and foreigners spend hours at the cafe, talking about art and politics.  I need to do research whether these coffees are still the rage today.

I think the US is getting better at adopting this wonderful feature, as in the last twenty years I have seen a wonderful growth in outdoor seating.  However, with the US philosophy of hurrying customers out so that the next group can be seated is not conducive to the cafe culture.  What are we missing?

“The Jewish Problem”
--------------------
I was totally ignorant of the tragedies the Jewish community faced in Hungary.  Alex Kershaw's book The Envoy was as exciting as any modern thriller, but filled with the horror of Hitler's terror.  This book is about Raoul Wallenberg, a Swede that traveled to Hungary as is attributed to saving 200,000 Jewish people from the death camps.  Raoul later disappeared inside the Soviet Union, and his family has looked for him for decades with no success.  


Hungary Today
-------------
I picked up Eleni Kounalakis's memoir of her times as the US Ambassador to Hungary, Madam Ambassador.  I don't know what I was expecting from this, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Eleni's description of her time in Hungary not only provided historical context, but revealed a lot about modern Hungarians.  Eleni herself is an amazing woman that should serve as a role model to many young girls today.

Having grown up in America, the Cold War and Iron Curtain were things that I learned about in school, but they didn't scare me or impact my life.  I had my own troubles that were more immediate.  However, this time in history impacted many people.  

To me, this is clearly highlighted in a story that Eleni shares about when she cut the ribbon for the first Starbucks to open in Budapest.  The woman who trained the baristas for Starbucks shared with Eleni that some Hungarians were stunned into silence when asked for their name for their order.  Does this sound crazy to you?  Such a common place today in the US when ordering food at many restaurants.  

I did not grow up in a country where I had to fear that anyone could be reporting to the government about my activities.  If you think the NSA listening in on your cell phone calls or tracking your shopping or web browsing history is horrible, you have no clue.  Get some perspective and read about how things were behind the Iron Curtain.  Read about Kati Marton's parents in the Enemies of the People and perhaps you will understand.
