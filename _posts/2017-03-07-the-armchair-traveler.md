 Join me as I explore the world from the comfort of home.  I love to read - fiction, nonfiction, teen fiction.  I even listen to books on tape in the car during my daily commute to squeeze in more books.  I find reading so relaxing, the systematic scanning right-to-left across the page.  There is no need to rush – the pages will be there forever.  I love escaping to another world, real or imagined, that money, time and life typically won't let me experience physically.  

I tend to read about a particular topic, especially when I have a trip coming up.  In a few months, I am traveling to several cities in Europe with my 10th grade daughter's social studies class.  We will be visiting Berlin, Dresden, Prague, Krakow and Budapest.  I have been to Europe many times, even lived and worked there, but haven't been to any of these cities.  So, I signed up to join a bunch of teenagers for 10 busy days!

The Armchair Traveler
---------------------
For the next several weeks, I will be reading about Dresden, Prague, Krakow, Berlin and Budapest.  I read fiction and nonfiction to really get a flavor of a place.  I thought I would share what I am learning with anyone that was interested.  Most people aren't readers, so I will do that for you and help distill out the elements I feel that really enhance travel.

When I travel, and I am more often on business than not, I am not in a city to hit all the tour sites to say “yeah, been there, saw that.”  I am there to honor a country's past and its people.  I think that is what traveling is all about – appreciating different histories and customs.  Yes, countries have great food, unique stores, beautiful sites to see, but all of this, to me, means so much more when you really appreciate the place and the people.

Guide books are filled with a bit of history, places to eat, drink, experience the night life, go shopping, and details on all the scenic places.  This, however, doesn't really tell me anything about the people that created these places, cook the food or make their daily lives in these cities.  This is why I read.  I can more fully immerse myself in what it is like to live in a city, and appreciate the hundreds of years that created what we see today.

Travel bloggers are all the rage with writing about unique spots with beautiful scenery and great food.  Finding off-the-beaten path restaurants, beaches and parks.  This is all fine, but for me, this is more about “saw the view, tasted the dish.”  To me, this is superficial.  I don't mean to belittle these people, I just want something more.

Books – Limited
---------------
I should say that I am a library armchair traveler.  I like to minimize my consumerism by checking books out of the library.  It is a way of recycling rather than buying books and letting them sit on my bookshelves.  Besides, I don't have the money to spare buying books.  So, my reading is limited to what I can find at my local library.  

I read actual books, and Kindle books at times.  I bought my Kindle prior going to France as I was paranoid about keeping my luggage to a minimum and having enough to read.  Thank goodness my library has Kindle books, and Amazon has a program to get them for free via their Kindle lending library.

Our Itinerary
-------------
Our adventure starts in Berlin.  We spend a day touring the city, and a second day visiting the remains of the Wall, Checkpoint Charlie, and a tour of Potsdam.  Then we are off to Dresden where we will swing by the Semper Opera House, Zwinger Palace, and the statue of Martin Luther.  

Next is Prague where we will visit the Jewish quarter, see St. Vitus Cathedral, walk along the Golden Lane, and cross the Charles Bridge with a final stop at the famous astrological clock.  Keep in mind, I know little about the scenic sites noted above, but will endeavor to learn more.

On our sixth day we head to Poland to visit Auschwitz and Birkenau.  I am not sure that I am prepared for the emotional visit this will be.  I have never visited a concentration camp before, or any monument to this great world tragedy.  I have scene Schindler's List, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas and know of the horror we will visit.  

We get to recover in Krakow where we will do a walking tour and see Wawel Hill, Glowny Square, and visit St. Mary's Church.  We have an afternoon free in Krakow, so I will have to do a bit more reading to find out what we should do with our time.

Our eight day is travel from Krakow to Budapest, with a lunch stop somewhere in Slovakia.   I am glad that we at least to set foot in this country.  We drive through the scenic Tatra Mountains.  I have been to the Alps, so I am eager to see this new range.

Our last two days of our trip will be in Budapest.  We will see the Parliament House and Matthias Church, and take a side trip to the Budapest Baths.  

First Stop - Budapest
------------------------
Unfortunately, I have started my reading in reverse and have begun with our endpoint - Budapest.  This is for two reasons.  First, about two years ago, I did some reading on Berlin.  We hear much of the horror of World War II from the perspective of those persecuted.  I was interested in what it was like to be a German in the midst of Hitler's Germany and to disagree with the Reich's path.  The second reason I decided to begin with Budapest is because I am about one quarter Hungarian (my mother's mother), and have always wanted to visit this great city.    

Join me on my adventure to select cities in Eastern Europe.
